            For investors, engagement is a powerful tool. BNP Paribas Asset Management uses its rights as a shareholder to pursue its ESG goals: “As an active shareholder we take regular stock of how we vote on climate change and board diversity,” said Billiet. “We opposed 34% of resolutions this year and proposed 700 resolutions.” The asset management arm of the Bank also reports on this activity, highlighting companies whose disclosures fall short. “We are in regular dialogue with these companies,” adds Billiet. “We work closely with them to promote best practice.”

            Existing frameworks have set the asset management industry on a common path, and the global financial industry has been an important catalyst for change. “BNP Paribas Asset Management is a committed sustainable investor – we were the first to integrate sustainability across the full range of activities: ESG is part of all investment decision-making,” he pointed out. “We have committed to a firm-wide approach for all investments and asset classes.”
