                If you’ve had to cancel or change your non-refundable flight, most airlines will offer you a credit instead of a refund. Here’s what you should know.
                <br>
                Flight canceled due to COVID-19? If so, the airlines are setting the policies for how you can redeem your airline credit. Many airlines are waiving change fees when it comes to rebooking. <br>
                Have a credit on a low-cost airline? To redeem an airline credit from a low-cost airline, such as Frontier or Spirit, contact the airline directly.

                Due to COVID-19, most refunds for flights, including when they’re part of a package, are issued within 12 weeks. Some refunds could take a bit longer, depending on the airline.
                <br>
                Refunds for hotel, car, or activity, including when they’re part of a package, are processed within our normal timeframe, 24 hours from the cancellation request. Keep in mind, your bank or payment service determines when the funds become available in your account.
                <br>
                In other circumstances not impacted by COVID-19, here’s what you should know about refund timelines:

                Online check-in allows you to check in for your flights online prior to your arrival at the airport. You can check in online via Traveloka App or website by following these simple steps:
                <br>
                1. Log in to your Traveloka account. <br>
                2. Open your e-ticket through My Booking. <br>
                3. Tap Online Check-in. <br>
                4. Once you have agreed to the Online Check-in policy, fill in your check-in details. Then, tap the Check In button. <br>
                5. When check-in is successful, you will be able to see the boarding pass through your e-ticket. It will also be sent to your email.
                <br>
                Please note that you need to bring a printed boarding pass to the departure gate. If you can’t print it yourself, you can have your boarding pass printed at the check-in counter.

                If you have not received the e-ticket/voucher within 60 minutes after completing your payment, it is possible that you might have entered the wrong one-time password (OTP) (if you paid by credit card), the wrong account number, or the wrong amount (if you paid by bank transfer).
                <br>
                In any case, please upload your payment proof so our team can conduct further checking. Here’s how you can upload your payment proof on Traveloka desktop website.

                Our suite at Trump International was huge! The marble bathroom was beautiful. Two bathrooms with showers and a huge sectional couch in sitting area. Only thing I would suggest is to have Terry robes for guests. Also, I was surprised that it only had one restaurant although, the food was superb!

                The property was nice but I didn’t get to experience the pool. Tried going twice and both times it was closed. First time was because of after hours and next time it was so to maintenance.
                Booking our trip through Expedia was easy. The property at Trump Towers, Las Vegas beautiful!!! We stayed in a corner suite which has lots of space and a full kitchen with beautiful views of the city!
