        <h1><em>KakaoTalk</em> Relationship <b>Milestones</b> That Are Worth</h1>

          <div class="title active">From “Just Dating” to Exclusivity</div>
          <div class="desc active">
            In the store of life, it can be challenging to find the perfect fit, but once you do, it’s very fulfilling.
            <br><br>
            It’s at this point that you might decide to become exclusive and work on building your relationship. This relationship milestone is a great start, and worthy of recognition.
          </div>
          <div class="title" data-image="images/app-capture-02.png">Saying “I Love You!”</div>
          <div class="desc">
            Who says it first? This is a semi-scary relationship milestone because in order to tell your love interest that you love them, you’re gambling with your heart.
            <br><br>
            What if you utter those three little words and your love interest just stands there and replies, “That’s nice”? Ouch.
          </div>
          <div class="title" data-image="images/app-capture-03.png">Meeting Friends and Family</div>
          <div class="desc">
            This is a really critical relationship milestone. Receiving the Stamp of Approval from friends and family basically seals the deal.
            <br><br>
            Even though you may have fallen hard for your person, it always feels better if your family and friends think they are just as great as you think they are.
          </div>
          <div class="title" data-image="images/app-capture-04.png">Having Your First Fight</div>
          <div class="desc">
            It’s going to happen. No matter how in love you are, disturbances are going to take place.
            <br><br>
            As you become more at ease with each other, guards will drop, and the baggage that you’ve both been carrying will, at some point or another, spill out.
