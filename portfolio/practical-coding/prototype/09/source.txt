How was KEEMS Shoes started?

KEEMS Shoes was built on the belief in a better tomorrow. In 2006, our founder Blake Mycoskie pioneered the One for One® model after an inspiring trip to Argentina, where he met many children who did not have shoes. Since then, our community has helped provide shoes, sight, and safe water to more than 100 million people around the world.

Today, our model has evolved. We now give ⅓ of our profits for grassroots good — including giving cash grants and forming deep partnerships with community organizations to drive sustainable local change. Learn more about (Y)our Impact.
