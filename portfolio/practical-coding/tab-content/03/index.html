            This app was designed to reduce stress in even military vets, so it’s safe to say that it’s a powerful way to instill a sense of calm and relaxation in your mornings as well. There’s even a neat little feature where your progress is visualized as a tree that’s growing. And this makes it easy to see just how far along you are in creating a stress-free life through the exercises it shares.

            If your mornings are hectic rushes, then you probably need a way to slow things down. That way, you can actually take things in and make sure you’re working on goal-oriented tasks the rest of the day, instead of being swept up in the hustle-and-bustle of your morning rush. That’s where Omvana comes in.

            Visual reminders of your goals can be a very powerful way of driving up your motivation each morning. All it takes is a glance at your vision board to remind you “why” you’re getting up and working each morning. Even better—you’ll instantly have more drive to get your day going because of it.
