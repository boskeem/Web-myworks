          Ivy Lee is a name that CEOs, entrepreneurs, and managers should be familiar with. Back in 1918, he walked into the office of Charles M. Schwab, the president of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, and shared with him a technique that Schwab later said was the more profitable advice he had ever received.

          This was the first goal-setting technique I was introduced to as a young entrepreneur. It actually originated from a management paper by George Doran, former Director of Corporate Planning for Washington Water Power Company, back in 1981.

          The key to this technique is setting goals that are within reach, that are specific, and can be measured. For example, you have to hand out flyers. Your goal should not be “to hand out 1000 flyers in two hours.” The reason is that you cannot control if people will take the flyers.
